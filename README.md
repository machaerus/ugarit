# Ugarit Magic Library

This is a small utility to easily search and download academic papers with CLI. 

Note: Ugarit is in very early stage. I plan to turn this into a full-fledged app that will be easily usable by non-geeks on all popular platforms. One day. So far I'm playing around. You're welcome to join my efforts to make this world a better place for academics and students.

Please donate to [SciHub](https://sci-hub.tw/), support them and spread the word.
